Goal: Create a production-ready mini web app that scans a business’s current website, extracts brand
elements (logo, colors, fonts, name/tagline), renders a brand-accurate LaunchIn7 sample preview, and
captures leads with CTAs to rebuild their site in 7 days.
0) Tech + Project Setup
Framework: Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS. Server routes for API calls.
Performance target: 100/100 Lighthouse. Provide .env.example and README with setup/deploy steps.
