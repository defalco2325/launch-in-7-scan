The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed due to an error related to loading the Vite config file - specifically, Vite could not find the 'vite' package imported from 'vite.config.ts' file.

**Solution:**
1. First, ensure that the 'vite' package is included in the 'package.json' file or was committed to the repository.
2. Since the error mentions that Vite couldn't load the config from 'vite.config.ts', you may need to make sure that the 'vite.config.ts' file is correctly configured and accessible within the project.
3. If 'vite.config.ts' is a custom Vite config file, verify that it is set up correctly with the necessary configurations.
4. Check if there are any typos or mistakes in the import statement for the 'vite' package within 'vite.config.ts'.
5. If the 'vite' package is devDependency, ensure it is installed and available in the project.

By addressing these points, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully build the project.
