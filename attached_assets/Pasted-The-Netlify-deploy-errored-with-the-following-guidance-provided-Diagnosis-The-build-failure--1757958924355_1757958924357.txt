The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is caused by the inability to load the Vite configuration file (`vite.config.production.ts`). Specifically, the error states `failed to load config from... vite.config.production.ts` and `Cannot find package 'vite' imported...`.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the `vite` package, specifically version `7.1.5`, is included in the `package.json` file or has been committed to the repository.
2. Ensure that the `vite.config.production.ts` file is present in the correct location in the repository.
3. If the `vite` package is missing or the file is not in the expected location, rectify the issue based on the verification step.
4. If the `vite` package is missing, you might need to add it to the `devDependencies` in the `package.json` file and run `npm install`.
5. If the `vite.config.production.ts` file is missing or mislocated, make sure to include it in the correct location.

By addressing these issues, the build should be able to locate and load the Vite configuration file successfully.
