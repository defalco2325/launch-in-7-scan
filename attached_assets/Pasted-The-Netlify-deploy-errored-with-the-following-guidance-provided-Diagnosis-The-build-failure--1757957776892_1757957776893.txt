The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is caused by the command `vite` not being found when running the build script.

**Solution:**
To fix this issue, you need to ensure that `vite` is installed and available in your project dependencies. Verify that `vite` is listed as a dependency in your `package.json` file. If it's missing, you need to add it to your project by running:
```bash
npm install vite --save-dev
```
Once `vite` is installed, the build script should be able to find and execute it successfully.
