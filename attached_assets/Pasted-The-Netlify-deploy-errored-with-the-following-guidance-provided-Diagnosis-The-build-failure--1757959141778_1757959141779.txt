The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failure is due to the error "bash: line 1: ./node_modules/.bin/vite: No such file or directory" at [line 74](#L74) in the logs. This error indicates that the build script is trying to run Vite using a local path that is not found.

**Solution:**
To resolve this issue, the user should update the build command in the `netlify.toml` file to ensure Vite is accessible and runnable. Since Vite is a development dependency, it might not be available in the production build. To fix this issue, the user should modify the build command to use the globally installed Vite binary:

1. Verify that Vite is listed as a development dependency in the `package.json` or was committed to the repository.
2. Update the `build` command in the `netlify.toml` file to use the global Vite binary:
   
   ```toml
   [build]
   command = "npm ci && vite build --config vite.config.production.ts"
   ```

By making this change, the build script will use the global Vite binary, which should be available and resolve the "No such file or directory" error during the build process.
